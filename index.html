            <p class = "storyp">Mark died just before Christmas 2002. He and I had only 18 months together before he died but I had absolutely no doubt that we were life partners. We shared the same interests, we had the same life goals, we clicked into each other's lives and families, and absolutely everything we did together was so much fun. I loved him with every fibre of my being and I know he felt exactly the same about me. Then he had a recurring episode of an illness that had plagued him for pretty much all his adult life and he had to go to hospital for two weeks. They treated him and he got better. The night before he came home I decorated every room in the house with these silly little signs that said "Welcome Home".</p>

            <p class = "storyp">I was the newcomer to the group, along with Elizabeth. I guessed she was in her late forties, but sorrow has a way of making age indeterminable. Elizabeth had just lost her son, Charlie, that month. She found Charlie after he hanged himself in her garage. (All names used in this story have been changed to protect subjectsâ€™ privacy.) Before the meeting, we were both escorted into a side room off the hall, away from the group. A counselor explained to us how the system worked, and asked about our loved ones and ourselves. Elizabeth had a hard time speaking through her tears. We were given name tags and ushered into the group. Everything I had anticipated and concocted in my mind about what was next to come turned out to be wrong.</p>
